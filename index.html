        <h2>Welcome to the Emotion Detector Project by Rohan Joshi and Christopher Rodriguez</h2>
        The goal of this project is to classify emotions into 7 main classes (some of the most common emotions). <br>
        Once you enter an image, a convolutional neural network will classify your
        image into one of these classes. <br> This project uses the FER2013 dataset to train 
         (<a href = "https://www.kaggle.com/ananthu017/emotion-detection-fer">here</a>)
        so please put the images in that format if you hope to obtain accurate results</p>
        <p>Please upload files here</p>

        <!-- form where user can upload an image for classification -->
        <form method="POST" action="" enctype="multipart/form-data">
          <p><input type="file" name="file"></p>
          <p><input type="submit" value="Submit"></p>
        </form>
